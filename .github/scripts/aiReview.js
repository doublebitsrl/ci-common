const userPrompt = `You are a senior technical evaluator. You will be given a code snippet or technical solution from a candidate. Evaluate it objectively on a scale from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) based on these five criteria:

1. Functional correctness: Does the code meet the requirements and run without errors?
2. Performance: Is the implementation efficient and free of unnecessary overhead?
3. Modularity & maintainability: Is it organized into reusable, testable modules/functions?
4. Readability & style: Are naming, formatting, comments, and overall clarity high quality?
5. Requirements completeness: Does it fulfill the brief exactly, using the required APIs and handling edge cases?

For each criterion, provide:
- A numeric score from 1 to 10
- One brief sentence of justification

Finally, compute the arithmetic mean of the five scores and return **only** the final overall score (a single number between 1 and 10).
